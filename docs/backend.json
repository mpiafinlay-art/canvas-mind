    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support CanvasMind's core features - Visual Canvas, Note Organization with AI Assistance, Real-time Collaboration, Multimedia Integration, Database and Authentication, and Voice Dictation - while adhering to the core design principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control), QAPs (Rules are not Filters), and Invariants.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** Authorization is enforced using path-based ownership for user-specific data. CanvasBoards and CanvasElements are stored as subcollections of users, eliminating the need for `get()` calls in security rules and enabling atomic operations.\n\n**Clarity of Intent:** The structure explicitly defines ownership and relationships, making authorization intent clear. User-owned data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, and nested data follows a hierarchical structure.\n\n**DBAC (Database-Based Access Control):** Roles and permissions are managed solely based on the `request.auth.uid` and path-based ownership, avoiding the use of custom claims.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** The segregation of user data into separate collections enables secure `list` operations. Users can only list CanvasBoards and CanvasElements that belong to them.\n\n**Invariants:** The structure supports the integrity of ownership through path-based ownership. Timestamps can be enforced using security rules.\n\n**Justification:**\n\n*   `/users/{userId}`: This collection stores user profiles. Security rules will ensure that only the authenticated user can read/write their profile data.\n*   `/users/{userId}/canvasBoards/{canvasBoardId}`: This subcollection stores canvas boards owned by a specific user. The `userId` parameter establishes ownership. Each document contains the properties associated to the boards.\n*   `/users/{userId}/canvasBoards/{canvasBoardId}/canvasElements/{canvasElementId}`: This subcollection stores canvas elements associated with a specific canvas board. The `canvasBoardId` and `userId` parameters establishes ownership. Each document contains the properties associated to the elements."
